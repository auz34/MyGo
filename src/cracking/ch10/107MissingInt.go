// Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer that
// is contained in the file. Assume you have 1GB of memory available for this task.
// FOLLOW UP
// What if you have only 10 MB of memory? Assume that allthe values are distinct and we now have no more than one
