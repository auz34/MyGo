// You have a stack of n boxes with width wi, heights hi, and depths di. The boxes cannot be rotated and can only
// be stacked on top of the another if each box in the stack is strictly larger than box above it in width, height,
// and depth. Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest possible stack.
// The height of stack is the sum of the heights of each box.
