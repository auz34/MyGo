//2. Given a 2D matrix of booleans, find the biggest continuous square submatrix of "trues" and return its dimension.
//Example:
// t t t t t t
// t t t f f f
// t t t f f f
// t f f t t f returns 3

// t t f t
// f t f t
// t t t t
// f t t f returns 2

// f f
// t t returns 1

// f f f
// f f f
// f f f returns 0


// 3. The problem:
// There are a row of houses. Each house can be painted with three colors: red, blue and green.
// The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
// You have to paint the houses with minimum cost. How would you do it?
// Note: The cost of painting house 1 red is different from that of painting house 2 red. Each combination of house and color has its own cost.

//Example:
//3 houses:
//r = [1,4,6], g = [2,100,2], b = [3,100,4]
